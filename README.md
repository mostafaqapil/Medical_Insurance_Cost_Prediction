Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

This project predicts the medical insurance cost based on various features such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The model is trained using linear regression techniques from scikit-learn and the dataset contains records of 1338 individuals.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict medical insurance costs based on the following features:

Age: The age of the individual.
Sex: The gender (male or female).
BMI: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
Children: The number of children covered by the insurance.
Smoker: Whether the individual is a smoker or not.
Region: The region where the individual lives.
Charges: The medical insurance cost.
Features
Data Visualization: The project uses seaborn and matplotlib to create various plots to visualize relationships in the dataset, such as:
The correlation between smoking and charges.
How BMI affects insurance charges.
The distribution of charges across different regions.
Modeling: The linear regression models implemented include:
Simple Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is called insurance.csv. It contains 1338 entries with 7 columns:

age: Age of primary beneficiary.
sex: Insurance contractor gender, female or male.
bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body fat.
children: Number of children covered by health insurance.
smoker: Whether the beneficiary is a smoker.
region: The beneficiaryâ€™s residential area in the US, one of four regions.
charges: The individual medical costs billed by health insurance.
Results
The model performance is evaluated using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for both training and test datasets. The Lasso and Ridge regressions are also implemented to test how regularization affects model performance.

Future Improvements
Possible improvements could include:

Feature engineering to create more meaningful variables.
Applying more complex models such as decision trees or random forests.
Cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the model.
